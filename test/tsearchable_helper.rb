      nothing beats a big bathtub full of chocolate mousse.  pudding seems a bit to slimy.
      mousse is silky and smooth.  moose are not silky.  they are hairy, and pretty damn big.
      never try filling you bathtub up with moose.  that is extremely dangerous.
      moose is dangerous, mousse isn't.  it's a common mistake.
      the words look too damn similar
